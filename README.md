## Differences with hardware

We have tried to make the VCV implementations as authentic as possible, however there are some minor changes that have been made (either for usuability or to bring modules in line with VCV rack conventions and standards).

* TODO: Polyphony, touch pads, other?

## Source repo for hardware versions

More information and resources for the hardware versions can be found at https://github.com/BlackNoiseModular/Eurorack
